# Robotic Solutions

This project was designed as a homework assignment for MSU's coding bootcamp. 

This application was created to emphasize the use of MERN (MongoDB/MySQL, Express, React & Node.js) Also, this project was introduced the class to how to work in a team enviroment and how to use create branches and submit branches back into the master file without causing breaks in the program. Plus the lesson on how to deploy the MERN application to Heroku.

This project has been deployed to my Personal GitHub Page and Heroku. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment links that have been included in the Link Section below.
